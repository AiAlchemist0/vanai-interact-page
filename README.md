## 🚀 Local Development Setup

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (version 18.0 or higher)
- **npm** (version 8.0 or higher) or **yarn** (version 1.22 or higher)
- **Git** for version control

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bc-ai-survey-platform.git
   cd bc-ai-survey-platform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install
   
   # Or using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run dev
   
   # Or using yarn
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
   - The development server will automatically reload when you make changes

### **Build for Production**

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

### **Environment Setup**

No environment variables are required for basic functionality. The app works out of the box with the included audio files and demo data.

### **Troubleshooting**

**Port Already in Use:**
- Change the port in `vite.config.ts` or use `npm run dev -- --port 3000`

**Audio Files Not Loading:**
- Ensure audio files are in the `public/` directory
- Check browser console for CORS or file path issues

**3D Graphics Performance Issues:**
- Try using a different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled
- Check if WebGL is supported: visit `chrome://gpu/`
